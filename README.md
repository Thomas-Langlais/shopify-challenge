## Design desicions
* I will be using NodeJS to build the API
* I will be using [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) to host the server
* I will use [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)'s to hold and manage the session data
* I am currently most comfortable with using PostgreSQL as my database
* I will be using a postman collection to test my API
* I will be using test-driven design to be sure that what I need to accomplish functions as expected.
